# Pre-Built Binaries Distribution

This repository acts as a **central hub for distributing pre-compiled binaries** (e.g., frameworks/libraries for iOS, macOS, Android libraries, or executables). 

It contains **no source code**; all artifacts are available exclusively via [Releases](https://github.com/DelphiWorlds/Binaries/releases)

## Overview
Releases provide zipped binaries with preserved folder structures and version-specific details. Check individual release notes for any special instructions, and build info (e.g., Xcode version used).

## Quick Start
1. Visit [Releases](https://github.com/DelphiWorlds/Binaries/releases) and select the desired version.
2. Download the relevant ZIP file(s).
3. Unzip to a folder accessible by your dev environment
4. Update any paths to the folder in your project (if necessary)

## Notes
- **Updates**: New releases may update specific binaries — older versions stay downloadable.
- **Feedback**: Have questions, issues, or requests? Open an [issue](https://github.com/DelphiWorlds/Binaries/issues).
